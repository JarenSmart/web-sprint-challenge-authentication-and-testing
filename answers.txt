1. Differences between using _sessions_ or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication.
    - JWT are stateless and take up less resources, making them more scalable
    - JWT have signatures that are encrypted
    - JWT have authentication access across multiple locations, while sessions work across a single-domain

2. What does `bcrypt` do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.
    - it takes what would be a 'string' password and hashes it into a cyrptic string of letters and numbers making it more difficult to guess

3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing.
    - Unit tests are tests that are between individual points that stand alone without integration or dependencies
    - Integration tests focus on testing modules that work together as one, or have multiple points that connect on the way to the end product 

4. How _Test Driven Development_ changes the way we write applications and tests.
    - It allows us to program based on circumstances that we want checked and implemented. This allows us to write more programmitcally
        driven code.
